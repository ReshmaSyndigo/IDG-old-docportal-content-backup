In Riversand Platform, an entity manage event records the changes occurred on the managed data. When you perform CRUD (Create, Read, Delete, and Update) operations at entity level, attribute level or relationship level, entity manage events get generated. 

This section covers the following scenarios to explain the usage of RESTful APIs in the Riversand Platform SDK to get events:

* [Get Events of an Entity when a Context is Added](api_event_get_scenario1.html)
* [Get Events of an Entity when an Attribute is Added to a Context](api_event_get_scenario3.html)
* [Get Events of an Entity when an Attribute is Updated in a Context (Entity History)](api_event_get_scenario4.html)
* [Get Events of an Entity when a Relationship is Added to a Context](api_event_get_scenario6.html)
* [Get Events when an Entity is Deleted](api_event_get_scenario11.html)
