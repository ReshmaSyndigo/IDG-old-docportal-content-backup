Riversand Platform has a predefined list of classification, country, channel, color and locale. Each one of them has a list of reference values associated with it. Before creating models such as manage model, validation models for each of these, you must ensure that the required lists are defined in Riversand Platform.

This section describes the object structure of each of the above predefined lists:

* [Classification](api_classification_list_data_model.html)
* [Country](api_country_list_data_model.html)
* [Channel](api_channel_list_data_model.html)
* [Colors](api_colors_list_data_model.html)
* [Locale](api_locale_list_data_model.html)
