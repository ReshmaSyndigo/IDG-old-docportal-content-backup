This object defines base relationship models for a particular [domain](api_domain_data_model.html). You can then create various relationship models of this base relationship model type as per your business requirements. With these relationship models created, you can create the corresponding related relationships and use it for various [Manage models](api_manage_model.html). 

Certain relationship models comes out-of-the-box (OOTB) when you deploy Riversand Platform. The following table lists OOTB relationship models:

| Name of the relationship models | Description |
|--------------------|-------------|
| thingdomainrelationshipmodels | Indicates the relationship models related to "Thing" domain. |
| partydomainrelationshipmodels | Indicates the relationship models related to "Party" domain. |
| locationdomainrelationshipmodels | Indicates the relationship models related to "Location" domain. |
| referencedatadomainrelationshipmodels | Indicates the relationship models related to "Reference Data" domain. |
| genericdomainrelationshipmodels | Indicates the relationship models related to "Generic" domain. |

The following table lists the details of relationships in Riversand Platform:

| Relationship | From | To |
|----------|-------------|------|
| contains | Entity Type | Entity Type |
| productischildof | Product | Product Group |
| crosssell | Entity Type | Entity Type |
| ischildof | SKU | Product |

This topic describes the relationship model object structure using a sample scenario. {% if site.build == "internal" %} See [Create Relationship Model](api_create_data_model_scenario64.html) for more scenarios and examples.{% endif %}

## Scenario

The following example demonstrates the sample JSON format to create "crosssell" relationship model.

<pre><code>
{
  "entityModel": {
    "id": "crosssell_relationshipModel",
    "name": "crosssell",
    "type": "relationshipModel",
    "domain": "thing",
    "properties": {
      "externalName": "",
      "data": {
        "relationships": {
          "listedUnder": [
            {
              "id": "",
              "direction": "both",
              "relationshipType": "aggregation",
              "relTo": {
                "id": "thingdomainrelationshipmodels",
                "type": "list",
                "mergeMatrix": [
                  {
                    "mergeSequence": "Brand Bank>>Ice Cat>>User",
                    "ignoreMergeMatrix": true
                  }
                ]
              }
            }
          ]
        }
      }
    }
  }
}
