An app is a combination of software modules referred to as Facets which solves a business use case and utilizes additional storage and processing than the SaaS solution.

## UI Plugin Facet

The UI plugin facet can communicate with core data platform, or other facets, like visualisation, analytics, or connector and provide completely new features/functionalities that the core platform does not have.

The existing app's functionality is not being customized but extension or addition is being made to the core appâ€™s functionality by creating new UI Apps.
* **Widgets**: Widgets are easy-to-use applications or components with some visual and interactive elements with them along with some business logic. It has self-contained functionality in a single frame which can be embedded in an app as a plugin. For example: Recent Activity Screen. 
* **Business Functions**: Business functions need not have visual elements. It can be related to configuring a button to perform an action that is defined as part of add-on app. It has self-contained functionality in a wizard which can be triggered from an action (like button, menu) from an app. For example: Send Mail.

## Visualization Facet

App to create a new visualization report using already analyzed data provided.
* **Report Dashboard**: A live report formed using a collection of reporting widgets which provide at-a-glance insights into your data and enable you to drill down into details.
* **Report Widget**: A reporting widget is visual representation of the data typically in charts such as bar, pie, column, area, line, network, goal & gauge, tag cloud, tabular etc.
