There are broadly four vectors that effect the integration pattern and practice within an organization:
* "Where" data exchange occur – Channels (S3, FTP, File Share, Connectors)
* "How" data exchanges occur – Formats (RSJSON, RSExcel, RSXML, RSDSV, Custom)
* "What" data is exchanged happen – Data Payload (Full vs. Partial / Contextual)
* "When" data exchanges occur – Events (Scheduled vs. Manual or System Triggered)

The following illustration depicts the integration patterns based on the Channel, Formats, Data Payload, and Events:
