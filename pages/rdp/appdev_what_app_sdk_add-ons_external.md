## App
An app is a combination of software modules referred to as Facets which solves a business use case and utilizes additional storage and processing than the SaaS solution. Riversand will certify if the new App created qualifies to be an App or just a new visualization customization on existing data. A set of tools, resources, documentation and example apps using which new apps can be created to be deployed as complementary capabilities on the Riversand Platform.

## SDK
A Software Development Kit (SDK) is essential to provide business scale for the varied use cases and nuances our customers and partners encounter managing & analyzing master data.

## Facets
Facets are software modules within the add-on app where each uses certain SDK capability. The UI facets are built on top of the UI capabilities of the SDK to extend the UI functionality. The connector and/integration extension facets uses the extension capabilities of the SDK to provide additional behavior and functionality for integration and connectors.  The analytics facets uses the batch processing engine of the analytics capabilities to provide a processing module in the add-on app. The visualization facet uses the visualization capability of the SDK to provide report rendions of the data the app is processing.
