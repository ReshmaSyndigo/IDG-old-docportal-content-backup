A binary stream object in Riversand Platform is a JSON structure that contains the meta-data details about the assets such as documents, images, and videos saved as entities in Riversand Platform. Broadly, a binary stream object contains the following sub-objects:

* [Request Level Attributes](#request-level-attributes): Contains attributes required for processing the request.
* [params](#params): Contains any additional parameters required for processing data in the request.
* [binaryStreamObject](#binarystreamobject): Contains all the required information of the binary stream object.
* [properties](#properties): Contains the properties of the asset such as path, original file name, and user/role permissions if any.

{% include callout.html content="**Notes**: 
* The API allows you to upload and download only one asset at a time with a maximum file size of 250MB.
* The binary stream object information is a flush and fill process. This implies that if you wish to update a binary stream object, then you still use the create API to flush and fill the data.

This topic describes the binary stream object structure using a sample scenario. 

## Scenario

Consider that you wish to upload an asset "toteBag.png" in Riversand Platform. The following example demonstrates the sample JSON format used by the **{{site.data.rdp_glossary.createbinarystream}}** API to create a binary stream object:

<pre><code>
{
  "binaryStreamObject": {
    "id": "guid",
    "type": "binarystreamobject",
    "properties": {
      "objectKey": "toteBag@_@guid.png",
      "fullObjectPath": "rdp/binarystreamobject/assets/toteBag@_@guid.png",
      "originalFileName": "toteBag.png",
      "user": "vendor@riversand.com",
      "role": "vendor",
      "mediaAssetId": "hIq27aTfRaOR4olBEXe1b"
      "ownershipData": "Vendor1"
    }
  }
}
</code></pre>

The following section describes the properties of the binary stream object in detail using the above scenario. Note that each section in this topic contains two aspects:

* Properties and description of each object. 
* Using the properties how you can set data for the [sample scenario](#scenario).

## binaryStreamObject 

This object is the parent container that holds all the required information about the binary stream object. The following table lists the details of the binary object:

| Property | Description | Type | Required |
|----------|-------------|------|----------|
| id | Indicates the unique identifier of the binary stream object. Id is alpha-numeric with a maximum length of 128 characters. If it is not provided, then an Id is generated by the Platform. | String | No |
| type | Indicates the type of object. Currently the supported values is binarystreamobject. | String | Yes |
| properties | Indicates the properties of the asset such as objectKey, path, original file name, and user/role permissions if any. | [properties](#properties). | No |

{% include callout.html content="**Note**: Only 'id' and 'type' are required when you are uploading and downloading an asset to and from the external storage respectively. 'id' for upload and download is the unique ObjectKey that is used to refer to the asset in the external storage. Id must be in the format <<fileName>>@_@<<GUID>>. GUID is alpha-numeric with a maximum length of 128 characters.
" type="primary" %}

Data for sample [Scenario](#scenario): Set the following properties for **binaryStreamObject** object:

| Property | Description | 
|----------|-------------|
| id | toteBag@_@guid.png |
| type | binarystreamobject |

The following sections describe how to set the values for [properties](#properties) and [data](#data) objects.

## properties  

This object stores the properties of the asset such as path, original file name, and user/role permissions if any. The following table lists the details of the properties object:

| Property | Description | Type | Required |
|----------|-------------|------|----------|
| objectKey | Indicates the path where the asset is stored in the external storage. | String | Yes |
| fullobjectpath | Indicates the path of the asset that is uploaded from | String | Yes |
| originalFileName | Indicates the original file name of the asset. | String | Yes |
| user | Indicates the user who can access and maintain this asset. | String | No |
| role | Indicates the role that can access and maintain this asset. | String | No |
| ownershipData | Indicates the ownership user for the asset. This can be used to provide the permission such that the user who creates the asset only can access and maintain the asset. | String | No |
| mediaassetId | Links the digital asset ID with the original entity while uploading assets via UI. When you are uploading assets via UI, the application generates a "mediaAssetId" and sends this ID to RSDAM as part of the asset metadata. Then the RSDAM sets the same "mediaAssetId" as digital asset Id and directly links the entity to the media assets. |

Data for sample [Scenario](#scenario): Set the following properties for the **properties** object:

| Property | Value | 
|----------|-------|
| objectKey | rdp/binarystreamobject/assets/toteBag@_@guid.png |
| originalFileName | toteBag.png |
| user | vendor@riversand.com |
| role | vendor |
| ownershipData | Vendor1 |
