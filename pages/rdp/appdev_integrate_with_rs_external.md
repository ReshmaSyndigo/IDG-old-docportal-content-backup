To create custom or new App, it is required to integrate your exisiting application/platform with Riversand Platform. To do so, app developer should go through a mandatory registration process to obtain access to the SDKs or GitHub repositories, and to receive future announcements. The registration process is managed by cloudOps team.

The registration process will allow the app developer to: 

* Register for each app SDK and obtain unique **app id** from Riversand to track and access all SDK App repository in github. CloudOps team will create the repository for app developers from the add-on template.

* Once created, the developer can access SDK related github repositories (such as Reference Apps & packages) and obtain client id/secret key to authenticate and authorize API calls from the apps.

* Clone a github development template for the apps development structure. 

* Utilize the artifact repository for extension development libraries.

Note that, all the existing apps need to be registered to obtain the app id, and Riversand will not host apps that are not registered.
