An App SDK is a devkit with set of tools, libraries, code samples, and so on to develop an application without writing the code from scratch. It provides opportunities/options to develop custom applications for every nuance and capability needed for business.

Riversand SDK provides an opportunity to partners and users to develop your own application based on your business use cases. With Riversand SDK development feature, a partner or user do not have to be dependent on Riversand Roadmap to solve the use cases. Using Riversand SDK, a partner or user can develop use cases faster and easier than existing methods as everything is pre-built. Riversand SDK also provides extensibility which does not break the seamless upgrades for SaaS strategy.
