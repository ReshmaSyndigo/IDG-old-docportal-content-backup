In Riversand Platform, certain external events are used for Import and Export services. Riversand Platform allows a user to delete external events which are unwanted by the user. By doing so, it increases the storage space of the system and also increases the speed at which the events can be executed.

This section covers the following scenarios to explain the usage of RESTful APIs in the Riversand Platform SDK to delete external events:

* [Delete External Events](api_event_delete_scenario5.html)
* [Get External Event History for Entity](api_event_delete_scenario6.html)
