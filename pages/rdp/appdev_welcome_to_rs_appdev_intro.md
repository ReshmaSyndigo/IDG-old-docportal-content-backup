Riversand Platform is providing software development kits to allow extensibility of the platform for partners and customers to leverage. Our users want to enhance the offerings provided to them with additional apps for their business use cases. Hence to develop these last mile apps, the application is enabled to provide extensibility by introducing Riversand App SDK.

The App SDK is a step towards expanding the development community beyond our internal development team. The Apps SDK will make it easy for Riversand apps development teams, customer development teams, external development teams to create and on-board new apps solving customers use cases faster and easier than existing methods.

This documentation focuses on concepts related to the developer experience while building an app for Riversand Platform. 
* The app developer starting development experience (How to start)
* The implementation experience using the available SDK and Documentations (How to develop)
* The app developer testing experience (How to test)
* The build and release cycle experience (How to build and what to release)
