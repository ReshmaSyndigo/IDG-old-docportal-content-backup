The Admin Object in Riversand Platform is a JSON structure that contains all the deployment related information. Broadly, the admin object contains the following sub-objects:

* [adminObject](#admincobject) : Contains all the required information for an admin object.
* [properties](#properties) : Contains the storageType, objectKey, and tenantId.
* [data](#data) : Contains data related to the object that is deployed.

This topic describes the admin object structure using a sample scenario.

## Scenario

Consider you wish to deploy platform seed data using a scenario. The following example demonstrates the sample JSON format to deploy platform seed data:

<pre><code>
POST **{{site.data.rdp_glossary.deployplatformseed}}**
Headers: Content-Type: application/json
Body:
{
  "adminObject": {
    "id": "someguid",
    "type": "adminObject",
    "properties": {
      "storageType": "stream",
      "objectKey": "platform-seed-rdw-1.1.1730-test.zip",
      "tenantId": "rdw"
    }
  }
}
</code></pre>

The following section describes the properties of the admin object in detail using the above scenario. Note that each section in this topic contains two aspects:

* Properties and description of each object. 
* Using the properties how you can set the data for the [sample scenario](#scenario).

## adminObject

| Property | Description | Type | Required |
