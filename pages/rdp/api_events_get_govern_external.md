In Riversand Platform, an entity govern event records the changes on the governed data. When entities passing through a workflow are validated against business conditions, business rules, or validation model rules, results in the entity manage events. 

This section covers the following scenarios to explain the usage of RESTful APIs in the Riversand Platform SDK to get events:

* [Get All Govern Events in the System](api_event_get_scenario14.html)
* [Get Workflow History of an Entity](api_event_get_scenario13.html)
* [Get Workflow History of an Entity for a particular Workflow Activity](api_event_get_scenario15.html)
* [Get Workflow History of one Entity without Sort on startdatetime](api_event_get_scenario18.html)
* [Get Govern Events for a particular Entity Type](api_event_get_scenario16.html)
* [Get Govern Events for an Entity based on Creation Date, Entity Type, and Entity Id](api_event_get_scenario17.html)
* [Get Workflow History of an Entity for a particular Workflow Activity and Business Condition](api_event_get_scenario19.html)
* [Get Workflow History of an Entity for a particular Business Condition and Business Condition Status](api_event_get_scenario20.html)
