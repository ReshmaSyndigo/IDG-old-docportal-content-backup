Riversand SDK provides access to dedicated Jenkin's job to build, deploy your app for testing purposes for a specific test tenant. Also, using the Jenkins job, you can release the test tenant app bundle to the app repository.

To get the Jenkin's job details and Jenkin's credentials, you must go through a one-time registration process with Riversand App Support Team. They will provide you Jenkins job Details and Jenkins credentials shortly after that.
