In Riversand Platform, an entity manage event records the changes occurred on the managed data. When you perform CRUD (Create, Read, Delete, and Update) operations at entity level, attribute level or relationship level, entity manage events get generated. 

This section covers the following scenarios to explain the usage of RESTful APIs in the Riversand Platform SDK to delete events:

* [Delete Entity Manage Event](api_event_delete_scenario1.html)
* [Get Manage History for Entity](api_event_delete_scenario2.html)
