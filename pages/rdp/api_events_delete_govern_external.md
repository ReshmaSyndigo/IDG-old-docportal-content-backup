In Riversand Platform, an entity govern event records the changes on the governed data. When entities passing through a workflow are validated against business conditions, business rules, or validation model rules, results in the entity govern events. 

This section covers the following scenarios to explain the usage of RESTful APIs in the Riversand Platform SDK to delete events:

* [Delete Entity Govern Event](api_event_delete_scenario3.html)
* [Get Govern History for Entity](api_event_delete_scenario4.html)
