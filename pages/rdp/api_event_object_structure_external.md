An Event Object in Riversand Platform is a JSON structure that comprises event details such as the event Id, event type, and domain along with the attributes containing details of the event. It contains the following sub-objects:

* [properties](#properties): Contains the audit information of the event such as createdBy, source, and modifiedBy. This is used for external events.
* [data](#data): Contains the event details related to the [contexts](#contexts), [attributes](#attributes), and [relationships](#relationships) details of an entity.

An entity event object can be identified using the following:

| Property | Description | Type |
|----------|-------------|------|
| id | Indicates the event Id that is automatically generated by the system. | String |
| name | Indicates the name of the event. | String | 
| type | Indicates the entity type. Possible values - entitymanageevent and entitygovernevent. | String | 
| domain | Indicates the domain associated to the event.| String | 

This topic describes the Event Object Structure using a sample scenario.

## Scenario 

Consider a SKU entity 'E01'. You have updated an attribute, 'displayname' in the entity. This JSON shows all the events corresponding to the entity.
