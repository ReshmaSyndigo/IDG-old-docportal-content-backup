Riversand Platform supports the locale messages for the Add-on applications. You can define your locale messages for Add-on Apps through the App repository managed by you. These locale messages get copied and updated during Add-on App deployment. After successful Add-on App deployment and updating the cache in the application, you can view the latest locale messages defined by you for Add-on App through the applicationâ€™s UI.

{% include callout.html content="**Notes:**
* You can define locale messages only for the language supported (currently 18 languages) by Riversand Platform. You can use the sub-set of these supported languages.
* All the defined locale messages and its translation must be provided by the Add-on applications developer. For example, if you wish to use the German language for your App in a locale message, then you must define the locale message and translated messages in Germany.
