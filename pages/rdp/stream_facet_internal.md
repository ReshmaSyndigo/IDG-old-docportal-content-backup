Stream Processing Facet allows you to develop an add-on streaming processing layer, which enables you to deploy and run the apps in your own stream processing layer. The stream processing layer performs real-time processing of streaming data to record and logs the real-time events. 

The Riversand stream processing SDK is a combination of interfaces and helper libraries to facilitate the stream processing app development. App developers can create the customized stream processing layer using the interfaces, helper libraries, and stream facet-specific configs in the App repository.
