REST API facet allows you to build Add-on RESTful APIs, which enables you to manage the data efficiently as per the business requirement. It is an out-of-the-box solution that helps you to develop and integrate the Add-ons as per the business logic. The Riversand Platform SDK is a combination of ServiceHandler class and RestAPI Annotation interface. App developers can create the customized RESTful APIs by extending the ServiceHandler class and RestAPI Annotation interface, and defining the REST API facet-specific configs in the App repository.
