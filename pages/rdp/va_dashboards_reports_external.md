The **Visual Analytics** is the data analytics app for the profiling of products and the corresponding governance information. You can easily perform interactive data analysis and visualize the data in a variety of charts and tables. You can view various reports displaying the statistics of entity, data quality, and workflows. 

The application allows you to manage your reports for better understanding of business decisions. You can identify the possible problems related at the earlier stage. **The visualization uses "Cardinality" Aggregation for displaying the count such as Entity, Context, Workflow, Business Condition and so on. The count that is displayed is not accurate and is based on data volume**. To view more entities you can drill-down the data for more details.
